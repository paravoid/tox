Make --hashseed default to PYTHONHASHSEED, if defined - by :user:`paravoid`.
The main motivation for this is to able to set the hash seed when building the
documentation with "tox -e docs", and thus avoid embedding a random value in
the tox documentation for --help. This caused documentation builds to fail to
build reproducibly.
